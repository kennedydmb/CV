                    <p>Resolving cash balance inconsistencies in branch.
                        On arriving at a branch and reviewing recent accounting reports there was a number of
                        unexplained errors and inconsistencies in cash balancing.
                        Undertook some analysis and investigation and observed staff actions, and identified a lack of
                        process being followed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Solution: Developed spreadsheet toolkit, and process map for staff to follow which resulted in
                        significantly reducing cash balancing errors and inconsistencies.</p>

                    <p>Identified improvements to branch layout making relevant stock more easily accessible to delivery
                        drivers which reduced packing time and degradation of product quality.</p>
                    <p>At another branch identified improvements in stock control inventory methodology resulting
                        reduced wastage and risk of products going out of date.</p>
